# Features

- Many scanning rules like improper trademark usage, or iOS bug üêõ mentions, or even swear word checker üòÆ
- You can use our pre-selected list of what we would use, or you can customize which rules to check for, so you have to run the rules you care most about.
- Customizable: you can decide if you want to warn üì¢ about potential problems and continue or have fastlane show an error üôÖ and stop after all scans are done.
- Paranoid mode if you want to be sure you‚Äôre doing all you can to avoid a potential rejection. This is most helpful when you need to get a hotfix out and you don‚Äôt want to take any chances it could be rejected.

# Quick Start

    sudo gem install fastlane

# Usage
Run fastlane review to check the app metadata from iTunes Connect

    fastlane review

To get a list of available options run
    
    fastlane review --help
    
# Example

Each rule can take extra configuration arguments from the fastlane review file.
Here are some examples a list of rules
 
built-in rules:

    spell_checking :skip # indicates that your metadata will not be checked by this rule
    trademarks :warning  # when triggered, this rule will warn you of a potential problem
    private_api :fail    # show error and prevent any further commands from running after fastlane review finishes
 

### Use with [`fastlane`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/fastlane)

`review` becomes really interesting when used in [`fastlane`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/fastlane) in combination with [`deliver`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/deliver).

Update your `Fastfile` to contain the following code:

```ruby
lane :production do
  deliver
  review
end
```

# How does it work?

`review` will access the `iTunes Connect` to download your app's metadata. It uses [spaceship](https://spaceship.airforce) to communicate with Apple's web services.
